// This is indicated with a question mark ? after the type, before the dot.
// Inside the body, you can test if this is not null by using question mark-dot-apply ?.apply.
// extension function on a nullable receiver

//val plant: AquariumPlant? = null
// plant.pull()
// => Even though plant is null, the function pull() still runs however thhe inner apply { } does not execute

//Output
//â‡’ GreenLeafyPlant
//AquariumPlant
// Commentary
// plant.print() prints GreenLeafyPlant.
// You might expect aquariumPlant.print() to print GreenLeafyPlant, too, because it was assigned the value of plant.
// But the type is resolved at compile time, so AquariumPlant gets printed.
